### Preserving Privacy with Monads ## {#russo}

*by [Alejandro Russo](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/)*

In a all-connected society, users consciously (or unconsciously) value their
privacy. Even skeptical people will recognize its importance; if they do not,
ask them to unlock their smartphone and hand it out to someone else---they will
most probably refuse!  Users want to have control on how their data gets
disseminated, specially today when private information gets handled by software
with heterogeneous trustworthiness---consider, for example, the various
smartphones apps with access to users' private photos, messages, and contacts
that exists today.  Unfortunately, current software practices are insufficient
to protect privacy: users who wish to benefit from software functionality are
often forced to grant access to their private data with no guarantees how it
gets handled. The key insight to guarantee privacy is not about granting or
denying access to private data, but ensuring that information only flows into
the appropriated places.

Information-Flow Control (IFC) is a research area dedicated to protect privacy
of data. Based on programming languages techniques, IFC scrutinizes source code
to track how data of different sensitivity levels (e.g., public or private)
flows within a program, where alarms are raised when privacy might be at stake.
IFC tools often provide specially designed compilers to build privacy-preserving
apps. Rather than building a compiler from scratch (a major task on its own),
Haskell plays a unique privileged role in this scenario: it can provide IFC
security via libraries. As long as developers program against the libraries'
API, code is secure by construction. This talk shows how to build such libraries
by specially designing monads capable to restrict the propagation of private
data. The presentation explores the different techniques used in a wide range of
libraries, namely LIO, MAC, and HLIO, where IFC is enforced dynamically (in the
form of an execution monitor), statically (by leveraging Haskell's type-system),
and as a combination of both.


**Short bio**: [Alejandro Russo] is an associate professor at Chalmers
University of Technology working on the intersection of functional languages,
security, and systems. He is the recipient of a Google Research Awards and
several grants from the Swedish research agencies Vetenskapsrådet, STINT, and
Barbro Osher foundation. Internationally, Prof. Russo worked on prestigious
research institutions like Stanford University, where he was appointed visiting
associate professor. His research ranges from foundational aspects of security
to developing tools to secure software written in Haskell, Python, and
JavaScript.
