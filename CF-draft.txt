== About HaL ==

The workshop series “Haskell in Leipzig”, now in its 11th year, brings together
Haskell developers, Haskell researchers, Haskell enthusiasts and Haskell
beginners to listen to talks, take part in tutorials, and join in interesting
conversations.

Everything related to Haskell is on topic, whether it is about current research,
practical applications, interesting ideas off the beaten track, education, or
art, and topics may extend to functional programming in general and its
connections to other programming paradigms as well.

This year, HaL is colocated with two related conferences,
 * the Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic Programming (WFLP) and
 * the Workshop on (Constraint) Logic Programming (WLP),
to form the Leipzig Week of Declarative Programming (L-DEC):

In order to accommodate and welcome a more international audience, this year’s
HaL will be held in English.

== Submissions ==

Contributions can take the form of
 * talks (about 30 minutes),
 * tutorials (about 90 minutes),
 * demonstrations, artistic performances, or other extraordinary things.

Please submit an abstract that describes the content and form of your
presentation, the intended audience, and required previous knowledge.
We recommend a length of 2 pages, so that the PC and the audience get a good
idea of your submission, but this is not a hard requirement.

You can submit your abstract, as an PDF document, at

   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hal2016

until Friday, July 1, 2016. You will be notified by July 15, 2016.
