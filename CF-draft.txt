== About HaL ==

The workshop series “Haskell in Leipzig”, now in its 11th year, brings together
Haskell developers, Haskell users, Haskell researchers, Haskell enthusiasts and
Haskell beginners to listen to talks, take part in tutorials and join in
interesting conversations.

Everything Haskellish is on topic, whether it is on current research, practical
application of Haskell, interesting ideas off the beaten track, education, art,
and may extend to functional programming and its connections into other
paradigms as well.

This year, HaL is colocated with two related conferences,
 * the Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic Programming (WFLP) and
 * the Workshop on (Constraint) Logic Programming (WLP),
to form the Leipzig Week of Declarative Programming (L-DEC):

In order to accommodate and welcome a more international audience, this year’s
HaL will held be in English.
