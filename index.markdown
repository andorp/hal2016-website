About HaL
-----

[Haskell](http://haskell.org/) is a modern functional programming language that allows rapid development of robust and correct software. It is reknown for its expressive type system, and unique approaches to concurrency and parallelism. Haskell is both the playing field of cutting edge programming language research and a reliable base for commercial software development.

The workshop series “**Haskel in Leipzig**”, now in its 11th year, brings together Haskell developers, Haskell users, Haskell researchers, Haskell enthusiasts and Haskell beginners to listen to talks, take part in tutorials and join in interesting conversations.

This year, HaL is colocated with two related conferences, the [Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic Programming]() (WFLP) and the [Workshop on (Constraint) Logic Programming]() (WLP), to form the [Leipzig Week of Declarative Programming]() (L-DEC). In order to accommodate this more international audience, this year’s HaL will be in English.
